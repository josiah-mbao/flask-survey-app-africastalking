# Church Survey USSD App with Flask and Africa's Talking API

## Overview

This is a Flask-based USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) survey application
for collecting feedback and responses from participants in my church, Ridgeviews Baptist Church.
The project integrates with Africa's Talking API to facilitate USSD communication.
My intention with this app is to give the church leaders valuable insights on how to better serve
their congregation. I believe that data-driven decisions can have a positive impact on 
increasing church attendence and overall engagement within the church as a whole.
I am using this project to also learn new technologies like Africas Talking, Flask and SQL.
Looking forward to the journey this will be.
